# AstroSmash-2021-Source-Code
In order to post to Lexaloffle.com I needed to put all of the files into one so if you look at the source code on Lexaloffle it may be a bit difficult to read so I am posting all of the original files here. Feel free reuse this code as you please.

One file contains the button mapping, another contains the colors, another contains the alarm library (for timing), another one contains the actual game code, and the last one contains the pico 8 cart.
